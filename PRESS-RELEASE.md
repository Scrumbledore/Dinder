## The Problem ##

It's been a hot, dog day - you're hungry, the fridge is empty, and you wouldn't have the will to cook even if you did have the ingredients. You went for pizza twice this week already, and don't relish the idea of another fruitless online search. Your mind is toast, and if you don't eat soon you'll be feeling nutty as a fruitcake. You've been working hard to bring home the bacon - you have a lot on your plate - and right now you have bigger fish to fry than to skim through restaurant reviews. But you guess that's just how the cookie crumbles...
